# Check if domains are available with a bash glob expression

I use a tiny bash function to check multiple domains at once, but I can't run it
in the phone, so I made it into a stupidly simple web service.

For example:

    $ curl -H 'text/plain' 'http://availabledomains.herokuapp.com/?e=thisis{awesome,amazing}.com'
    thisisawesome.com
    thisisamazing.com

Means both are available.
